                    I studied Maths, Physics, and Computer Science at A-Level at The Bridge Academy in London, and I'm passionate about AI and game development. I've been programming since 2018 learning Python through Codecademy, and applying my knowledge to coding challenges on sites like Codewars and Edabit. My passion for AI developed during my A-Level studies, where I spent time reading and learning about AI, and I'm currently learning TensorFlow for Python.<br><br>
                    My passion for game development started from the mock coursework we had done for Computer Science, where I had made a simple game using the Godot Engine. In my free time made another more complex game, available on my GitHub.<br><br>
                    Other than that I enjoy playing games in my free time, notably League of Legends and Rocket League - both of which I had reached the top 7% of players in.
